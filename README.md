<h2> About this project: </h2>

This API is my project for the [Professional Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/scikitlearn-ml/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

An API is built using Flask in order to integrate a model to a productive project. Using Sklearn, a pipeline is built in which a model is trained using data from the Happiness Index 2017, and which is capable to predict values for a target value (happiness score in this case).
